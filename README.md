You wake up one day... lost in the middle of space! How will you get home? What will you do? Play this game... make choices... and see if you can pass the test of SURVIVAL.

This is the original project I created as a Graphic Design major, prior to switching to Computer Science at my University. One may refer to this project as the "spark" that set off my interest in programming! 

This is a "Choose Your Own Adventure" text-based game. Created using simply HTML files and spiced up with a little bit of CSS, you maneuver through the game by clicking on the hyperlinks- these are the decisions you make and the actions that determine whether you survive and return to Earth... or die a slow and painful death....
